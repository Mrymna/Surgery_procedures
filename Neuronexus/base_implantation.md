# Base implantation

## Material to prepare

* Make sure you added the [4 nuts to your base](prepare_base.md) before starting this procedure.
* A suitable lid and a corresponding pcb plate.
* One ground screw and an additional screw that has been shorten at the bottom by a few 0.1 mm with the dremel. For specific implantation constellations, you have to shorten screws at the top as well (eg ground screw for LEC, anchoring screw for CA1)
* A microdrive holder with an attached microdrive. There should not be any probes mounted on the microdrive.


## Potential problem to avoid

One critical point when cementing the base to the skull is to make sure that you will have all the space needed to implant your microdrive later on. 
To make sure this is the case, I attach a microdrive with its case to the microdrive holder and position the microdrive at the coordinates needed for probe implantation.
I cement the base with the microdrive at the implantation sites. This ensure that the microdrive will fit in the base when we will do the probe implantation.

## Prepare the surgery setup
* beaker with alcohol, beaker with water, well with saline
* Instruments: scissors, 2 hemostats, tweezers, (skull scraper, screw drilling bit,) fine drilling bit (desinfected in alcohol)
* 0.3ml or 0.5ml syringe, screwdriver
* ear bars (desinfected in alcohol) attached to the frame
* arm attached to the frame, needle attached to the arm
* gas on, adjusted to 800-1000, pump on, heating pad on

## Prepare the animal
* Place the animal in the induction chamber until it is not moving and does not stay upright when tilted sideways (approximately 15 sec).
* Set the isoflurane to 2%.
* Fix the animal to the stereotaxic frame
* Set the isoflurane to 1.5%. Over the next 5-15 minutes, gradually decrease it until approx. 0.7-1.0%. Always watch the breathing of your animal.
* Apply a cream to protect the eyes (Bepanthen, Augen under Nasensalbe MIT 5% Dexpanthenol, Bayer).
* Cut the fur on the head, from the neck to between the eyes.
* Remove any hair left.
* Apply xylocain (Pumpspray, AstraZeneca) to the skin that will be cut and wait 1-2 minutes.
* Open the skin with scissors. One single straight cut is the goal.
* Retract the skin sideway with hemostats. Be careful not to touch the eyes.
* Cut the muscle attaching to the top of the bone at the back of the cerebellum. This is done with two cuts starting at the midline, one towards left and one towards right. Remove any soft tissue on the skull. There should be no muscle left at the posterior edge of the skull. A cotton tip soaked in saline can be helpful.
* For MEC/LEC implantation or similarly lateral implantation sides, cut the muscles at the side of the skull.
* Clean the skull with the skull scraper or the tweezers. Stop any bleeding if applicable. Use a cotton tip soaked in saline to remove remaining blood. You might want to blow some air at the skull to dry it. Make sure the skull is utterly clean and dry.

## Straighten the animal and mark your implantation sites

* Install an arm with a fine needle on the stereotaxic frame to measure the coordinates on the skull. Cave: The yellow rubber part of the stereotaxic holder is not quite fixed, so make sure that the needle holder is aligned with the stereotaxic frame.
* Make sure bregma and lambda are levelled in the DV and AP axes. 0.1 mm difference is ok but not more.
* For MEC/LEC/lateral implantation sides: Go 3mm from lambda to the left and to the right to make sure the height is the same.
* Have a look at the general orientation and position of the head without the microscope. If the head does not look straight, it probably isn't and try to align it.
* Find the AP and ML coordinates of bregma. and write them down.
* Calculate the coordinates of your implantation site. 
  * Hippocampus CA1 : AP: -2.0 mm, ML: 1.7 mm
  * ADN AP: -0.8mm, ML: -0.8mm
  * MEC: ML: 3.1 mm, AP: 0.2mm from the transversal sinus and 6 degree angle toward posterior.
* Mark the implantation site on the skull. For most sites, put 9 marks on the skull: 1 at the site itself, 8 marks forming a rectangle with the site in its center. I use 0.7mm distance from the implantation site for the axis with the shanks of the probe, and 0.5mm for the other one. For MEC implantatation, I draw a single line from the fissure in anterior direction. Then I drill a rectangle posterior to the fissure below this line, using the fine drilling bit and only removing the superficial layers of skull. 
* At that step the isoflurane should be <1.2%.

## Mark the sites for the ground and anchor screws

* Place the base on the skull at the approximate correct location.

* Use the microdrive holder to put the microdrive at the correct place, as if you wanted to implant probes.
* Make a mark with a pen for the anchor and ground screws. There is a hole in the base for the anchor screw. Make sure you are not placing the screw in a bone fissure or above a sinus.
* Move the microdrive away and remove the base

## Drilling and fixing the anchor and ground screw

You need to add one anchor screw at the front and one ground screw at the back.

* There are 2 ways of drilling holes for screws: Either you choose a small drill bit, tart with a smaller hole and test if you can insert the screw. If not, make the hole larger and repeat. The alternative is to use the screw drilling bit and drill vertically through the skull keeping the drill absolutely straight. Don't drill into the brain! 
* Remove any blood if applicable.
* Insert the screw with a screwdriver holding it with the tweezers. Screw down until it is fixed. There should be a small gap between the head of the screw and the skull.

 * Repeat for the other screw.

If you plan to implant the probe in the same surgery, drill most of the skull above your implantation site. Only leave a thin layer of skull that can be removed later.
By doing most of the drilling before cementing the base, you reduce the chance of weakening the bound between the cement and the skull.

## Cementing the base

* Bring back the base to the appropriate position. Make sure the ground wire is inside the base and pointing upward.

* Place the base in the correct position. Use the microdrive to make sure your are not placing the base at a position that would make the probe implantation difficult.
* Check if the base aligns with the skull. For most base types (eg MEC, LEC, ADN/MEC), there will be holes at the left and right posterior edge of the skull. For the CA1 base, you can skip the next step and proceed directly with cementing the base.
* Create walls out of cement at the edges of the skull where the base does not directly touch the skull. For this purpose, use rather solid cement; the cement should neither flow nor crystallize. You should be able the pull it along with the tooth pick. Make sure that you keep your implantation site free of cement. If any cement flows into the implantation area, separate it immediately from the wall with a fresh tooth pick and remove it, to avoid weakening the wall when you drill the implantation hole. Check if the base touches the walls repeatedly. You should avoid building too high walls because you might run into trouble lowering the microdrive sufficiently.
* If the base sits on the skull (with walls) in a stable way, you can proceed to cementing the base to the skull. Add some cement at junction of the base and the skull. Apply the cement only from within the base. The cement should flow under the base to grip the skull, but it should not flow into the skin or muscles. 
* Wait 5 minutes and move the microdrive away so that you have more space to apply the cement.

* Wait 15 minutes for the cement to solidify.

If you are implanting the probe in this surgery in addition to the base, go [here](https://github.com/Mrymna/Surgery_procdures/blob/main/Neuronexus/implantation.md).

## Suturing

* Use saline to clean the skin around the base.
* Sew stiches to close the wound. Normally, you need 3 stiches at the back and 1 at the front.

## Add the pcb plate

* Mount the pcb plate to the base. Try not to apply too much force on the plate or on the head of the animal.

## Add the lid

* Attach the lid to the base. Make sure that the ground wire is not coming out of the base-lid assembly.

## Carprofen injections

* Prepare your injectable solution of Carprofen.
* Inject 0.4 ml of Carpofen solution under the skin.
* Give the animal an additional injection every 24 hours for 2 days.

## Return to the home cage

* Move the animal back to its home cage. Make sure it has water available and perhaps some food directly in its cage.
