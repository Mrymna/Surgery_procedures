# Implanting Neuronexus probes

The picutres are from an implantation of 2 32-channel probes in the CA1 area. A similar procedure can be used for other brain areas or probes.

This assumes that the base is already on the head of the mouse.
If your animal does not have a base yet, go [here](https://github.com/Mrymna/Surgery_procdures/blob/main/Neuronexus/base_implantation.md).

## Make sure you have lids of different height

You will need a lid to cover the microdrive and implantation site. Depending on the height of the microdrive, you might need lids that are up to approximately 11 mm high. Make sure you lids of different heights before starting your surgery. 

## Inspect the probes
* Look at the probes under the microscope and make sure that they are clean. You should check the recording sites.

* Make sure you have a microdrive case with a nut cemented in it.
* Make sure you have a lid that fits you base and PCB plate.

## Adjust the shuttle height

For most implantation, you want the shuttle to be near the top of their range. 
I usually go down 2 turns from their highest position.

Before implanting, make sure the last shuttle movement was down. This will minimize lateral movement of the shanks when you will move the probe before recording. Ideally, you only move the shuttle down after implantation.


## Prepare the wax

Turn on the incubator to melt the wax that will protect the probes.

## Attach a case (shield) to the microdrive 

The case around the shield allows the recovery of the microdrive. We will cement the shield and not the microdrive to the skul. 

* Place the case on a streotaxic ear bar using two-sided tape. You should have the screws on the drives before moving down. 
* Lower the microdrive until you are so close to the case.

* Screw the case and microdrive together using the middle screw. Always look at your probes to make sure they never touch the ear bar. You can feel when the screws go to the nuts. Only apply gentle force and do not overtighten the screw. This screw is the only part securing the microdrive to the case.
* Position the probes so that they are approximately 1-2 turns from their top position. Use the two screw that are located towards the back of the animal.

* Move the probes out of the way to a safe location.

## Prepare the animal
* Place the mouse in the stereotaxic frame. 
* Put some protective lotion/cream on the eyes of the animal. 
* Remove the lid and the pcb board. 
* Make sure that the skull of your animal is leveled. 
* Use compress air to remove any dust from inside the base plate. 

## Prepare the implantation site


* Add some saline to the skull to soften it and wait a few minutes.

* Bring the probes to the marked implantation sites and make sure that they can reach the sites. If you have 2 implantation sites, make sure that the probes have the right relative height.
* Move the probes to a safe location.
* Drill the implantation sites making as little damage as possible to the dura or the brain.
* Remove the dura with little possible damage that is possible. This is a key step to get good recording.
* Make sure the brain/dura is cover with saline solution as much as possible. Don't leave it to dry.

* Remove any excess of blood with sponge or tissue before incerting the probes. 

## Probe insertion
* Bring back the probes to the implantation site.
* Lower them to the brain surface and measure the DV coordinate.
* Lower the probes below the surface of the brain. 
* Apply melted wax to the base of the probes. Be very careful not to touch the probes with the needle. The wax should not come too high. You should leave enough space to be able to move down the shuttles of the microdrive without having to move them into the wax. If the wax touches the shuttles, you can try melting it with the soldering iron to make space for the shuttle to go down. Do not apply excessive heat.

Insertion depth
* ADN 1.8 mm
* CA1 0.6 mm
* MEC 0.8 mm


* Make sure you have enough space for the shuttles to go down.

## Cementing the case of the microdrive to the base plate and skull

* Apply cement on the wall of the case towards the front. The cement should flow down under the case. 
* Make sure that the cement does not come back to touch the probes, i.e. keep an eye on your probes.
* Add cement to the outside wall of the case, on both side. Always make sure you do not cement the microdrive to the case!!!
* Look regulary to the probes to make sure you are not cementing the probes. 
* Wait 15 minutes to give time to the cement to solidify.

## Attach the PCB plate to the base

* This is the most delicated part. You need to hold the PCB plate with your fingers while moving it from the holder to the base.
* Make sure you never pull on the ribbons that are attached to the probes.
* Unscrew the screw holding the PCB plate to the holder, move the PCB plate to its receptacle on the base plate.
* Start tightening the screws to the base. Apply just enought force to secure it to the base. You will thighten it later on.
* Be genter with the screw driver because you could move the head and destroy the probes.

## Solder the ground screw
* Solder the ground wire to the point where you had the wire before. 
![](figures/groundwire.jpg)

* Make sure while you are soldering that the ground wire dont touch the probe.

## Disconnect the holder
* Disconnect the holder by unscrewing the two screw at the front of the holder. 
* Slowly move the holder up, making sure that you are not pulling the microdrive up with it.

## Close the lid and secure the 4 structural screws
* Add the lid with the right height, which depends on the height of the microdrive (9-11 mm).
* Make Marks on the lid above the 2 screws lowering the probes.
* Drill holes in the lid that will allow access to the screw without removing the lid.
* Clean the lif with alcohol 70% and dry it with paper tissue..
* Put the lid back on and thighten the lid and PCB plate screws.

## Inject carpofen
* Inject 0.4 ml of diluted carpofen with saline sub. cutaneous.

## Test the quality of the signal
* Connect your probe to the recording system to make sure you have good signals.
* Best of luck with your recordings :D
