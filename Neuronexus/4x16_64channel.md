# 4x16 probe configuration with Intan 64 amplifier


To be able to make sense of the data from the probe, we need to reordered the channels so that the channels from a shanks are grouped together from the highest to the lowest recording site on the shank. This is needed for visualisation (when looking at the oscilloscope) and for spike extraction.
